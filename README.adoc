*algen* is a pure Lua (LuaJIT) library designed for **Al**gorithmic **Gen**eration.

.Principles
Portability:: A generator must have consistent output and state format across platforms.
Stability:: A generator must have stable output and state format over time, i.e. backward compatibility.
Performance:: Generating random data is a fundamental operation which can be heavily used by complex generations, thus performances might be critical.
